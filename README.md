# üñ© Simple JavaScript Calculator

This project is a basic calculator web page created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two input numbers. Unlike a physical calculator, this calculator takes two numbers entered into text boxes and displays the result upon pressing the "Equals" button.

### üõ†Ô∏è Code Overview

- **HTML**: Provides a simple form layout with input fields for numbers, buttons for operations, and a result display.
- **CSS** (optional): Adds basic styling for layout and appearance.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the arithmetic calculations based on user inputs, responding to button clicks for operations.

#### JavaScript Functions

In `script.js`, key functions are defined to perform each operation:

- **`add()`** - Calculates the sum of the two input numbers.
- **`subtract()`** - Calculates the difference.
- **`multiply()`** - Calculates the product.
- **`divide()`** - Calculates the quotient, with error handling for division by zero.
